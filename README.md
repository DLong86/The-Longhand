# The Longhand - My F1 Blog

Welcome to The Longhand, my F1 blog! This is where I will be posting articles about my views from the past to current formula 1 drivers, news, stories and my thoughts on the latest F1 races.

## Technologies Used

- MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- Authentication (Login and Register pages)

## About the Project

This is a personal project where I am building a blog to share my passion for F1. I am using the MERN stack for the web application, and implementing authentication for user registration and login.
